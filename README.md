# EAGLE Company
![alt text](https://github.com/ZukisaNante/EAGLE/blob/master/assets/img/eagle.jpg "The Future")

> Eagle company was established by four BeCode junior web developers.
> They all hold qualifications from different desciplines but web development brings them together.
> After long discussions on how the company should have impact on our society and economy they decided to come up with an idea on how to overcome traffic and improve environment to avoid climate change disasters.

# Company vision and mission

 > Our vision is to see that the future generation has a better environment and that their dreams can be seen realised   without the  threat of climate change. We believe that better means of mobility/transportation with new technology techniques will add value on decreasing climate disasters. The CO2 (carbon dioxide) produced by cars can be at least eliminated by this technology.
  ---
> Our mission is to provide means of better mobility by minimising and eradicating air pollution, stress caused by traffic on daily basis commuting to and from work and to bring joy and fun. Wouldn't be fun to fly and not stuck in traffic and seeing nice views from the sky? Of course it would! We hope to work with government institutions, small and big companies and organisations. Moreover, to reduce fatal road accidents and initiating future transportation means.

- All our jetpacks abide to the ISO standards under International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
- Our motto "safety comes first" is one of the priorities we commit ourselves to serve.
- Instructions are also provided in our app and at the station when you pick up your selected choice.
- Our jetpacks cannot operate or start the engine without alcohol and drugs test first.
- Provided you are under any influence of any of the above mentioned substances the system will freeze the motor, meaning it won't work.

## BeCode Assignment

> - Junior Web Developers were given a task to make a project by inventing a company and design its webside.
> - They were a group of four with their names appearing on their website.

---

### Assignment Objectives

> - To revist and master the HTML, CSS, Sass, and Bootstrap Framework skills learnt far-off.
> - To work with templates.
> - To work in a team and individually.
> - To be able to make decisions on your own and as a group.
---
### Acquired Skills

> - Soft skills
> - Communication skills
> - Listening Skills and tolerance.
---

### Conlusion

> After working together we have realised the importance of communication skills.
> We also, found ways to avoid conflict on disagreements by looking at the positive side of any suggestion and take it as challenge.
> Furthermore, during our research it became clear that the future means of transportation in the world may lead to minimising the climate challenges.
> That being said, it is obvious that we need to work together to accomplish this and involve more of the government sectors. Government will play a big role here as jetpacks can't be owned by everyone (they are expensive to own, therefore, we can share them). Therefore, financial support will play a big role on establishing our business as we plan to provide our transportation means to the poor, richer, young and older and moreover to diverse communities.
> We conlude by encouraging every individual to support this plan and to think about the future of their children.
> What the world faces now is not something that can be undone in a day or a year but continuously and together we can. 
> Climate change is real and our current mobility system is contributing a lot to it and to stress levels that the employees and employers get due to traffic jam and accidents. Safety first and let us brighten our future by taking initiative and responsibility to our hands. Jetpack mobility is the key.
