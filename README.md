# EAGLE Company
![alt text](https://github.com/ZukisaNante/EAGLE/blob/master/assets/img/eagle.jpg "The Future")

> Eagle company was established by four BeCode junior web developers.
> They all hold qualifications from different desciplines but web development brings them together.
> After long discussions on how the company should have impact on our society and economy they decided to come up with an idea on how to overcome traffic and improve environment to avoid climate change disasters.

# Company vision and mission

 > Our vision is to see that the future generation has a better environment and that their dreams can be seen realised   without the  threat of climate change. We believe that better means of mobility/transportation with new technology techniques will add value on decreasing climate disasters. The CO2 (carbon dioxide) produced by cars can be at least eliminated by this technology.
  ---
> Our mission is to provide means of better mobility by minimising and eradicating air pollution, stress caused by traffic on daily basis commuting to and from work and to bring joy and fun. Wouldn't be fun to fly and not stuck in traffic and seeing nice views from the sky? Of course it would! We hope to work with government institutions, small and big companies and organisations. Moreover, to reduce fatal road accidents and initiating future transportation means.
